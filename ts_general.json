Without replay protection, you could lose your cryptocurrency when trying to use the fork.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3. The blockchain of the fork must be online, active, and running. This requirement effectively means that miners are working to keep the blockchain alive and that the blocks are created at a regular period.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4. The forked coin must be backed by a development team which regularly updates the codebase. Without this assurance, the fork might just be a get-rich-quick scheme at the expense of investors in the coin.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>5. The cryptocurrency must be supported by reputable services, such as exchanges or wallets. No-name or previously unknown exchanges are not considered reputable.</p>\n<p><strong>SatoshiLabs reserve the right not to support a fork even if it addresses all the needed conditions, when we think that the support is not appropriate.</strong></p>\n<p>Basically, all forks that we want to support are announced through our social media.
